# Hashtables
Implementation of an example Hashtable

## Explanation
A hashtable is data structure formatted as an array of "buckets."

Buckets are simply a key/value pair stored in a certain index position within the hashtable(array). 

In a hashtable, index positions can multiple buckets but a "perfect" hash table only has one bucket per index position.
