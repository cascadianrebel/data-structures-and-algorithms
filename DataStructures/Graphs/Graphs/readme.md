# Graphs
Graphs are non-linear data-structures made up of vertices (commonly referred to as nodes). The connections between the vertices are called edges. 

Since graphs can be written as vertices, it's easy to visualize that these are used in GPS mapping. Additionally, since edges can have weights (value), graphs can also be used to find the shortest route between two points like airline traffic control. 

## Explanation
The following is the example graph created by the console application. There are 5 vertices in the example. Nodes 2, 3, and 4  have 3 neighbors. The node 1 has two neighbors. Node 5 shares only an edge with node 4.
