# Insertion Sort
Insertion sort can take a unsorted array and return the same array but in ascending order. 
## Implementation
I created a method that calls itself (recursion) to sort the array in an ascending order. Within the method is a loop that will continually go through the index positions and switch the following with the former position if the following position is smaller than the former. 

## Visual
How the method works is demonstrated below:

The Code Example below shows the recursion method used to sort an array.

The console displays:

## Uses
This particular method is not the most efficent way of sorting data. It should only be used for smaller arrays. My immediate thought was this would be a well used in a scoreboard for a game.
