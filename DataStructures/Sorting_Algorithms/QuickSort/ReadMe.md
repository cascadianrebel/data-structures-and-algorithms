## Explanation
Quicksort is an algorithm that divides and conquers an unsorted array to return the array in ascending order.

This algorithm assigns a variable, Pivot, to a particular index position then partitions the array into sections where the index position is lower or higher than the pivot. 

It is called recursively until each partition is in order. 

In this implementation, the pivot is first set to the highest index position in the unsorted array.
